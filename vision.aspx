That’s why we believe it’s important to be true to who you are, so that you can feel confident, beautiful, free, and always you. We draw, design, cut, sew, wash, dye, deconstruct &amp; reconstruct, and bring our vision to those of you who want to bring out what is within. </p>
<p>We understand that options are important to you and we are here to bring you those hard to find pieces. Whether it’s crochet lace you want to wear, or the color white, we take the trends and translate them into pieces that speak to you and maintain the aesthetic that makes our brand unique. </p>
<p>Each collection starts with a concept. That concept is based on a combination our designer’s travels, research, and instinct. With over 12 years of experience as a lead designer at both small and large retailers, her experience, coupled with her creativity, aesthetic, and endless passion for art and design, enables Avow Apparel to bring you pieces that are unique to the market. Selecting colour and print is as important as engineering the actual construction of the garment. From fully finished interior details to ensuring the right fit, our designer strives to make sure that every detail is taken into account. </p>
<p>Our inspiration is drawn from the world around us. We love to travel and embrace the beauty of the textiles, colours, foods, sounds, and sights of the cultures we encounter. With each collection you will see hints of our travels. Whether it’s in a print or embroidery, or in a colour story, fabric, or silhouette, our journeys are a constant source of inspiration.</p>
<p>Everything from concept to colour, print selection to graphic design is conceptualized in house. Every pattern is made by expert patternmakers to ensure that the fit of our garments is as superior as the design. Fabrics are specifically developed and engineered to cater to you and each style is constructed with impeccable attention to detail. If you are looking for clothing that is not only fashionable but also high quality, comfortable, and easy, you found it.</p>
<p>Avow Apparel provides you with collections that speak to who you are within. We want to fill your closet with pieces you love &amp; styles that take you on a journey no matter where you are going.</p>
