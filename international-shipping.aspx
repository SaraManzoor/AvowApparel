                                        <p><strong>You may be responsible for import taxes or other customs fees imposed by your home country.</strong> These taxes are not included in your order and are calculated by customs officials of each individual country, and are therefore difficult to estimate prior to shipment. While we take steps to minimize or eliminate the cost of importing for our customers, we must provide accurate information to customs officials.</p>
                                        <p>Please note that items ordered together may not be shipped out on the same day or in the same box, and occasionally, some items are temporarily out-of-stock. If your items are sent in more than one box you will receive tracking information for all boxes associated with your order. If an item is on back-order or is out-of-stock you will be notified at the time of order. Should there be any other delay associated with your order you will be notified within 7 business days after placing your order.</p>

                                        <p>Avow Apparel ships all orders through the United States Postal Service. Once your package arrives in your home country that service is taken over by your local postal system. In the event that the delivery attempts have failed and the local postal service was unable to get your package to you it is your responsibility to follow up on the whereabouts of your order. Avow Apparel will not be held responsible for packages that are not followed up on or picked up by the customer. In addition, any shipping charges that are incurred as a result of packages being sent back to us are the responsibility of the customer. If you choose to have the items delivered back to you, after they have been returned to us, you must pay for all applicable shipping charges. You will also be responsible for any applicable customs fees, import taxes, and any other duties assessed.</p>
