<p><strong>FAILED DELIVERY ATTEMPTS</strong></p>
<p>From time to time the United States Postal Service experiences failed delivery attempts. In the event that you are unavailable to receive your package for any reason the courier will leave a USPS info notice on your door or in your mailbox. It is the responsibility of the customer to follow up on such notices. Avow Apparel will not be held responsible for packages that are not picked up before they are sent back to us. In addition any shipping charges that are incurred as a result of such instances are the responsibility of the customer. If you choose to have the items delivered back to you, after they have been returned to us, you must pay for all applicable shipping costs.</p>
<p><strong>RETURN SHIPPING</strong></p>
<p>To return item(s) for a refund please make sure your item(s) meet the criteria mentioned in our Return &amp; Exchange Policy. We request that you package the item(s) in a secure carton or in the original packaging. When you are ready to return the item(s) please log into your Avow Apparel account, go to your order history, click on the order, and follow the prompts. A return label will be emailed to you. Please print the label, secure it onto the package, and drop it in a mailbox. You may also take it to any authorized United States Postal Service facility. Please note that you will be charged the return shipping fee. If you misplace your return label or accidentally delete the email containing the label, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Info@AvowApparel.com">Info@AvowApparel.com<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">

Please see above chart for return shipping rates.</p>
<p>Please allow 2-3 weeks for your return to be received and processed. Most returns are processed within 7 days of receipt in our warehouse. All returns are shipped back via USPS Standard Parcel Select. As soon as your return is processed you will receive a confirmation email. A refund will be issued to the original form of payment. Remember, every financial institution has it's own processing times and funds will be made available accordingly. You may also check the status of a return by clicking on the tracking number in the confirmation email.</p>
<p>Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer except in cases of product defect or error on the part of Avow Apparel (for example if incorrect product(s) was shipped.) In such cases, Avow Apparel will pay for the cost of return shipping as well as the cost of shipping the correct or non-defective product(s) out to you. As stated in our Return &amp; Exchange Policy, all reduced price merchandise &amp; merchandise purchased at in-person events such as pop up shops, trade shows, etc. are final sale and no refunds/exchanges will be granted towards such items. In cases of product defect or error on the of Avow Apparel, you may return reduced price merchandise and merchandise purchased at in-person events for a full refund. If, in such cases, you would like the order to be replaced with the correct item/non-defective item of the same style/colour/size as indicated on the original order, this will be subject to availability and Avow Apparel cannot guarantee that the product(s) will be in stock at the time the return is processed. In cases of product defect or error on the part of Avow Apparel, a new item will be shipped to the customer, using the same shipping method as on the original order, within 3 business days (provided that the item is still available in our inventory) and shipping costs will be paid for by Avow Apparel. Shipping times outlined at the top of this page will apply.</p>
<p>Packing the product appropriately, and attaching the shipping label correctly is the responsibility of the customer. Avow Apparel will not be held responsible for products that are damaged as a result of insecure packaging. Such products will be shipped back to the customer and applicable shipping charges will automatically be charged to the default payment method stored in your account. Avow Apparel will not be held responsible for return packages that are mislabeled and are sent back to the customer or sent to a different address. In such cases, if the customer chooses to ship the items back to us, the cost of doing so would be his/her responsibility and not that of Avow Apparel.</p>
<p>Please be sure to read our Return &amp; Exchange Policy to ensure that your return meets the criteria for a return/exchange. All returns sent that do not meet the criteria in our Return &amp; Exchange Policy will be shipped back to the customer and all shipping costs will be charged to the method of payment associated with the original order or to the default method of payment saved under your user account.</p>
